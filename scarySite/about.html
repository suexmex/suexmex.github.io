            This scare-site was created by two high school students in web design. The goal of this site is to tell a story through digital means. In order to achieve our goal, we utilized html5,css3, and JavaScript to create the site you are looking at today.

                The midnight man is an old Pagan ritual, used mainly as punishment for those who have broken the                     laws of the Pagan religion in question. While it was mainly used as a scare tactic to not disobey                    the gods, there is still a very existent chance of death to those who play the Midnight Game. There is an even higher chance of permanent mental scarring. It is highly recommended that you DO NOT PLAY THE MIDNIGHT GAME.

However, for those few thrill seekers searching for a rush, or for those delving into obscure occult rituals, this story is a short synopsis on what might happen if you play. Do so at your own risk...
