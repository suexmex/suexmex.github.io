    <p>	One night, Devin and I decided to play the midnight man game. We got our materials ready at about 9:00 pm: papers, white candles, salt, a needle, matches, and a pencil. Time passed as we started formulating our strategy for playing the game. We made sure all the lights in the house were turned off. Soon enough, it was 12:00 am. We each wrote our name on a piece of paper, then we put a drop of our blood on our paper. Before officially starting the game, we each light our candles. Devin helps me synchronize the 22 knocks and I get it just right. I open the door, we blow out our candles, and we close the door. We relight the candles and begin the game. </p>
            <br>
            <p>&#34;Now we&#39;re supposed to keep moving or the midnight man will find us or something.&#34; Devin says. We leave my room and head to the other side of the house. Devin asks if we&#39;re allowed to eat during the game. &#34;I actually don&#39;t know,&#34; I replied. &#34;Just don&#39;t open the fridge because the light might provoke the midnight man and get us disqualified.&#34; Devin proceeded to eat, and minutes later, he came back out. I checked my watch by candle light- it&#39;s 12:59 and our candles are just fine. I suggested that we head back to the side of the house with my room on it, and we settle on the hallway near the bathroom. Suddenly, my candle goes out.</p>
