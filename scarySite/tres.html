    <p>	Never in my life have I ever wanted to run from anything in my life so badly before now. I didn&#39;t run; I stuck by Devin as he nervously relit the candle. He definitely took longer than me, but not exceeding ten seconds. We speedwalked back to the living room. Our candles were still intact. At the same time, we both looked to the couch. The figure from the bathroom was sitting on the sofa. The temperature in the room dropped. The living room was normally the hottest room in the house, up until that moment. I remembered another sign of the midnight man. Indications that you are near the Midnight Man will include sudden drop in temperature, seeing a pure black, humanoid figure through the darkness, and hearing very soft whispering coming from an indiscernible source.  Then, as if things couldn&#39;t get any worse, our candles went out. I immediately made myself a salt circle, and Devin did the same for himself.</p>
            <br>
            <p> &#34;Devin, I&#39;m sweating bullets. What time is it?&#34; I asked. Since his candle was out, it took a lot of squinting, but after about 2 minutes he replied, &#34;2 in the morning. We gotta stay here until 3:33. That&#39;s when the midnight man leaves.&#34; While that was the rule, we stayed in our salt circles until it was 4:00, just to be safe. After that, we went to sleep. 
When I woke up, my left side was on fire. When I looked in the mirror, there were long, red scratches that looked as if they had been bleeding. Soon after, Devin complained that  he had the same scratches, but on his back. Do not play this game. It is not worth it.
