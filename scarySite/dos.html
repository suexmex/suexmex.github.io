    <p>	I panic, remembering one of the game&#39;s guidelines. If your candle goes out, the midnight man is near. DO NOT take more than ten seconds to relight your candle. I relighted the dumb thing in no more than five seconds. After that, we inched our way back to the other side of the house, because hurrying would be just BEGGING for our candles to go out. 
        &#34;Wait a minute.&#34; Devin said as he looked from my free hand to his. &#34;Where&#39;s the salt?&#34; My eyes went wide. &#34;Rats. It&#39;s on my bed.&#34; Devin let out a huge sigh, being careful not to blow out the candle. &#34;We have to go back for it. We won&#39;t survive without it.&#34; I agreed; the salt would probably end up saving our lives.</p>
            <br>
            <p> &#34;That&#39;s a risky move.&#34; I said, raising a brow. Devin reminded me of another important guideline of the game. If you are not successful in relighting your candle, you must then immediately surround yourself with a circle of salt. If you are unsuccessful in both of your actions, the Midnight Man will create a hallucination of your greatest fear, and rip out your organs one by one... You will feel it, but you will be unable to react. By the time we made it to the other side of the house, it was 1:30. I took both cans of salt from my bed and we ended up near the bathroom again. Things went horribly wrong from that point forward. I saw a completely black, humanoid figure standing in the tub. &#34;Dev, do you see that?&#34; I asked, not daring to point at it. &#34;Yeah man. Is that...&#34; Devin didn&#39;t get to finish his sentence as his candle went out. </p>
